- optimize buffers in *Compressor.cpp
  -> add streaming interface for those algorithms that support it? 

- allow to make subclass of LVPAFile that can insert custom data on write,
  and read custom data on read?

- Add delete mode for lvpak

- append mode: should refuse if key is wrong

- remove the progress bar from LVPAFile.cpp and lvpa library code, only lvpak should have it

- rewrite LVPAFile::SaveAs() -- someday

- split platform stuff from LVPAInternal.h and change global define names a bit.
